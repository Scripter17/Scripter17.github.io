	<h2>About me</h2>
	Hello! My name is James Wise, and this is my website!<br/>
	I am a 17 year old Canadian high school student whose primary hobbies are video games and programming.
	Although most of my more impressive projects are personal things that I haven't yet put online, the things on my GitHub profile still give a good look at my programming ability.

	<h2>My projects</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Scripter17/AlchemPy" target="_blank">AlchemPy</a>, a recreation of the game Little Alchemy made in Python</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Scripter17/news-clicker" target="_blank">News Clicker</a>, an idle game I'm making for one of my classes that is also commentary about current trends in news</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Scripter17/browser-elements" target="_blank">Browser elements</a>, and old JavaScript library that, if I get around to cleaning and updating it, will be a helpful lightweight solution to displaying parts of a website only on specific web browsers</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/Scripter17/jwBulkDOM" target="_blank">jwBulkDOM</a>, an admittedly less helpful library for applying things like CSS styles to multiple elements at once without needing to write a for loop.</li>
	</ul>

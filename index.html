	<h2>Hello! My name is James Wise, and this is my website!</h2>
	<p>I am a 16 year old high school student from Canada, and I'm planning to go into software development as a career. Being only 16 I don't have much to show for my experience, but what I do have on my <a href="https://github.com/Scripter17" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is still fairly impressive for my age</p>
</div>
<div class="content fade-in">
	<h2>Experience</h2>
	<p>Most of my real experience lies within web development, but I've had a fair bit of time with Python and, to a lesser extent, Node.js. Really I'm more of a jack of all trades, master of none. I realize that's not ideal, but it's gotten me this far.</p>
	<p>I'm pretty good with Python 3, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Generally I don't need to look something up unless I'm using PIL or Discord.py, and even then I've remembered most of the basics.<br/>
	I wouldn't say I know Node.js, but it's something I can use if need be. Knowing regular JS obviously helps a lot.<br/>
	When it comes to things like React, Vue.js and other JS libraries, I have no experience at all. Very rarely have I found something I couldn't solve in vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<div class="content fade-in">
	<h2>A bit more about me</h2>
	<p>I'm quite a curious person by nature. If I want to know how to add folders to Windows context menus then I will wade through 13 pages of search results to find the solution. If I don't understand something, then I <i>will</i> understand it. This has naturally lead to my love of mathematics and, of course, computer programming.</p>

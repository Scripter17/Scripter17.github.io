		<h2>About Me <a href="#AboutMe" tabindex="-1">#</a></h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is James Wise. I am a 15 year old Canadian high-school student trying to go into computer science/programming as a career.<br/>
		Being 15, I'm not very skilled with programming yet, but I've still made a few pretty cool things.</p>
		<p>I've had a passion for computers for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was little, I was obsessed with computer games, and I wanted to create my own.<br/>
		In middle school, I started learning Batch, which is the first time I've really dabbled with a programming language.
		Fast forward to today, and I've expanded far beyond that. I'm even starting to learn Powershell, the "sequel" to batch.</p>
		<p>I got into web development because I wanted to help with my dad's company website. Seriously, <i>that</i> is the reason.
		And if I may be so bold, I'd say I'm pretty good at it.</p>

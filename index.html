		<p>Hello, my name is James Wise! I'm a Canadian high-school student planning to go into computer science in the future.
		Some of the things I'm good at are Python, web development (front-end - HTML, JS, &amp; CSS),
		<a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, and <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>.</p>
		<p>I'm able to pick up on new things fairly easily, allowing me to go from knowing nothing about C++ to somewhat competent in only a few days.
		I was once able to complete an entire CS course in one month just because I knew most of it, and what I didn't know I figured out fairly quickly.</p>
		<p>Despite mostly working on smaller projects, I sometimes can do bigger ones (like this website).
		It's just that starting such a big project is a bit daunting, so I tend to not get around to them.</p>

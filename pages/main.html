	<p><span id="Greeting">Hello</span>! My name is James Wise! I am a hobbyist programmer currently in 12<sup>th</sup> grade at Hillcrest High School.</p>
	<p>My main interests are math and programming, with a fair bit of experience in both for someone of my age.<br/>
Most of my projects are tools and proof of examples. Sometimes I make tools to help with a videogame I like, and 	sometimes it's a tool to replace the already available ones.</p>
